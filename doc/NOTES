These changes to 3rd party components are needed on the igowo hosting infrastructure:

Django:
- Patch with django-crypt-patch.diff so we can reuse the user passwords in /etc/shadow

Roundcube modifications:
- program/include/iniset.php: removed magic quotes check (deprecated in PHP >= 5.3.0)
- skins/default/templates: removed autocomplete="off" (customer feature request)
